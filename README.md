#RAIN SAFE HANGER 

##ðŸ“Œ About This Project

The Rain Safe Hanger is an IoT-based automated system that uses an ESP8266 microcontroller, raindrop sensor, and stepper motor to automatically rotate clothes hangers to a protected position when rain is detected, while sending real-time Telegram notifications to users.

##Technologies Used:

Hardware: ESP8266 Microcontroller, 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor, ULN2003 Motor Driver, LM393 Raindrop Sensor
Software: Arduino IDE, WiFiManager Library, ArduinoJson Library, Telegram API (Pingnal)
Power Management: 9V Power Adapter with 5V regulated power supply module

##Key Features Developed:

Automated Rain Detection: Continuous monitoring using LM393 sensor with digital output for precise water detection.
Mechanical Protection System: 90-degree rotation mechanism using stepper motor for moving hangers to/from protected positions.
Smart Connectivity: WiFiManager integration for dynamic network configuration and automatic reconnection.
Real-time Alerts: Instant Telegram notifications for rain start/stop events with custom message formatting.
Persistent Operation: Auto-reconnection capabilities ensuring continuous monitoring even after power interruptions.

##PROJECT OUTCOMES

Successfully delivered a practical IoT solution addressing a real-world household problem affecting over 70% of households in regions without electric dryers, providing automated protection for outdoor laundry drying.
Demonstrated mastery of IoT integration principles combining sensor technology, microcontroller programming, mechanical automation, and cloud-based notification systems in a cohesive, user-centric solution.
Created scalable foundation for smart home automation with identified future enhancements including moisture detection, multi-hanger support, and voice assistant integration for expanded functionality.
